// A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

/* Adjancency List           VS              Adjancency Matrix  

- Can take up less space                     
- Faster to iterate over 
  all edges 
                                        - Faster to lookup specific edge
